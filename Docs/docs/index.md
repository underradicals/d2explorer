## Introduction

Hello, my name is Joseph. I have more than a decade of experience building software with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and a Master of Science in Information Technology working across several different disciplines:

### What Languages Do I Speak

- Front-End: `React`, `Typescript`
- Backend: `C#`, `Python`
- Databases: `SQLite`, `Postgres`, a little `GraphQL` and a little `MSSQL Server`, `SSIS`, `SSAS`, and `SSRS`
- Data Wrangling: `Python`, `Prefect`, `dbt`, `DuckDB`, (looking into) `MinIO`
- Systems Language: `C++`, a little `C`
- Other Tools: `Power BI`, `Excel`

### What is D2

{{ $frontmatter.description }} The pages found in this documentation site provided by [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) cover setup, tools, patterns, and white papers used in the development of not only the code but also the project.

This system is comprised of `11` projects: Each with its corresponding Backend and Frontend projects.

### Projects

- ##### Documentation Site

- ##### D2 Data Pipeline

- ##### D2 Pipeline UI

- ##### D2 Manifest API

- ##### D2 Manifest Explorer

- ##### D2 Data API

- ##### D2 Data Explorer

- ##### Auth Provider (Backend)

- ##### Auth Provider (Frontend)

- ##### Secrets Manager & Key Vault (Backend)

- ##### Secrets Manager & Key Vault (Frontend)

### Why So Ambitious

Anyone of these projects I believe would suffice as an adequate showcase of a developer’s skills, but in today’s market, I believe you need to go above and beyond to be seen. I have done some of these things at one point of another, but never have I done them all in one project, then culminating the totality of a system. There will be addendums along the way, that is just the nature of the beast.

### Enough Chit Chat

Let's get to it...Happy Coding!
