## Introduction

{{ $frontmatter.description }} The pages found in this documentation site provided by [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) cover setup, tools, and patterns used in the development of not only the code but also the project. Hello, my name is Joseph. I have more than a decade of experience building software with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, and a Master's of Science in Information Technology and this what I do...this is all I do, because this what I love. This system is comprised of `11` projects: Each with it's corresponding Backend and Frontend project.

### Why So Ambitious

Any one of these projects I believe would suffice as a adequate showcase of a developers skills, but in todays market, I believe you need to go above and beyond to counted as `cracked`, whatever that means. I done some of these things at one point of another, but never have I done them all in one project, then culminating the totality of a system. There will addendum's along the way I am sure, that is just the nature of the beast. I know I will need a load balancer or two, an api-gateways and etc. But I think of them as system details, and do not tell any particular part of the story.

### Enough Chit Chat

Let's get to it...Happy Coding!
