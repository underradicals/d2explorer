# Getting Started

## Setting Up Vitepress

I am not going to try and compete with Evan's team here, Vitepress Documentation is already amazing, and for more details you just navigate to [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/). But to just exaggerate how simple this framework is to use, these are the steps I took:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm add -D vitepress
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add -D vitepress
```

:::

After running one of these lines, go ahead and run the next line to scaffold you site:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npx vitepress init
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm vitepress init
```

:::

Go and look on vitepress's docs; learning about all of its treasures will make documenting your code so much easier. I have built my own, and trying to make everything work together is time-consuming. But with Vitepress, you will spend less time on tedious setup and more time on writing. Documentation is very important! This is how people will understand your dreams!
